    <section><p><strong>Hello, My name is Jaylin Gross a 26 year old Junior Full Stack Web Developer that is currently enrolled into the Michigan State University Coding Boot Camp. Prior to joining the bootcamp I had just recieved my Associate's degeree in Business Administration at Schoolcraft College located in Livonia, MI. After, graduating I began to reflect and do my personal research on what my next step would be and I decided tech was the way to go. Although, there are many different pathways into the tech industry that dont include web development I figured this was a skill that was and is rising at a lot of major companies and the demand is growing higher by the day. Also, I believe my skill set is perfect for this type of work.
