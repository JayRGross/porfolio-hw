          Hello, My name is Jaylin Gross a 26 year old Junior Full Stack Web Developer that is currently enrolled into the Michigan State University Coding Boot Camp. Prior to joining the bootcamp I had just recieved my Associate's degeree in Business Administration at Schoolcraft College located in Livonia, MI. After, graduating I began to reflect and do my personal research on what my next step would be and I decided tech was the way to go. Although, there are many different pathways into the tech industry that dont include web development I figured this was a skill that was and is rising at a lot of major companies and the demand is growing higher by the day. Also, I believe my skill set is perfect for this type of work.

          As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
        </p>

          And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
